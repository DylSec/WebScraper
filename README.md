This Web Scraper is part of Invertix Intern Challenge Week 1. 
This Scraper still grabs Java Script tags and throws it in the txt file.
This is clearly not the most efficient way to grab all the words. (we are new to python)
It also grabs some symbols like -, $, %, etc.
If anyone wants to make improvements for future use that would be awesome!
